## Prerequisites

- It is not recommended to run tests on your working project, since failed tests can leave behind
empty pipelines, triggers, etc. Set up your
[development environment](https://docs.mage.ai/contributing/development-environment).
- Make sure [user authentication](https://docs.mage.ai/production/authentication/overview) is enabled.
- Make sure your development server is running.

## Running the tests

You have the option to just run one specific test or all tests at once. There are
[several ways](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests) to run specific tests.

```bash
# Run everything, headless by default.
yarn test
# Run everything with a browser.
yarn test:h

# Run test files that have the word "pipelines" in their names.
yarn test pipelines
```

You can run the frontend tests using the CI/CD Playwright configuration with the following command:
```bash
yarn test:ci
```

## Creating a test

Refer to the [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) for examples on writing frontend tests.

## Debugging

The easiest way to debug is to run tests in UI mode so you can see what went wrong.

```bash
yarn test --ui

# Or
yarn test:ci --ui
```

If you are running into issues with the app and would like to report it, you can tell us about it either on [GitHub](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai/issues/new/choose) or [Slack](https://www.mage.ai/chat).
