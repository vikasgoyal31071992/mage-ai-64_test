In order to maintain the same quality pattern from Mage's data extraction, this Source allow's the user to specify which data source pattern is preferred. As of now, the avaliable backend sources are:

 - postgresql
 - mysql
 - mssql

OracleDB and Snowflake currently doesn't require a backend source.
Internal tables created by S3 and other Object Storage doesn't require a backend source as well.
